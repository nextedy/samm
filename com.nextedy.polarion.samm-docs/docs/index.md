## Why Open SAMM
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:

* Evaluating an organizationâ€™s existing software security practices
* Building a balanced software security program in well-defined iterations
* Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program
* Defining and measuring security-related activities
within an organization

SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind such that it can be utilized by small, medium, and large organizations using any style of development. Additionally, this model can be applied organization-wide, for a single line-of-business, or even for an individual project
